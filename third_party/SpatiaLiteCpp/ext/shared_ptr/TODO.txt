Test case:
* test the templated copy-constructor doing static_cast from <U> to <T>
* test bad_alloc exception!

Simple TODO:
* overload operators and swap as free member function
* uSTL (http://ustl.sourceforge.net/)
* SHARED_ASSERT() handler like in Boost

More complexe feature to add?
* np => counter -> count_base* = count_impl<X>
** delete X != T
** stored pointer != owned pointer
** empty != null
