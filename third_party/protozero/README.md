# protozero

Minimalistic protocol buffer decoder and encoder in C++.

Designed for high performance. Suitable for writing zero copy parsers and
encoders with minimal need for run-time allocation of memory.

Low-level: this is designed to be a building block for writing a very
customized decoder for a stable protobuf schema. If your protobuf schema is
changing frequently or lazy decoding is not critical for your application then
this approach offers no value: just use the C++ API that can be generated with
the Google Protobufs `protoc` program.

## Depends

* C++11 compiler
* Tests depend on the Google Protobuf library, but use of Protozero doesn't
  need it


## How it works

The protozero code does **not** read `.proto` files used by the usual Protobuf
implementations. The developer using protozero has to manually "translate" the
`.proto` description into code. This means there is no way to access any of the
information from the `.proto` description. This results in a few restrictions:

* The names of the fields are not available.
* Enum names are not available, you'll have to use the values they are defined
  with.
* Default values are not available.
* Field types have to be hardcoded. The library does not know which types to
  expect, so the user of the library has to supply the right types. Some checks
  are made using `assert()`, but mostly the user has to take care of that.

The library will make sure not to overrun the buffer it was given, but
basically all other checks have to be made in user code!


## Documentation

You have to have a working knowledge of how
[protocol buffer encoding works](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding).

* Read the [tutorial](doc/tutorial.md) for an introduction on how to use
  Protozero.
* Some advanced topics are described in an [extra document](doc/advanced.md).
* There is a table of all types and functions in the
  [cheat sheet](doc/cheatsheet.md).
* Read the [upgrading instructions](UPGRADING.md) if you are upgrading from
  an older version of Protozero.

Call `make doc` to build the Doxygen-based reference documentation. (You'll
need [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) installed.) Then open
`doc/html/index.html` in your browser to read it.


## Installation

Call `make install` to install include files in `/usr/include/protozero`. Call
`make install DESTDIR=/usr/local` or similar to change install directory.


## Endianness

Protozero uses a very simplistic test to check the byte order of the system it
compiles on. If this check is wrong, you'll get test failures. If this is the
case, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mapbox/protozero/issues) and
tell us about your system.


## Tests

Extensive tests are included. Call

    make test

to build all tests and run them.

See `test/README.md` for more details about the test.

You can also use `gyp` to build the reader tests:

    gyp gyp/protozero.gyp --depth=. --build=Release
    ./out/Release/tests

This will clobber the `Makefile` from the repository! Instead of `Release` you
can use `Debug` for a debug build.


## Coverage report

To get a coverage report compile and link with `--coverage`:

    CXXFLAGS="--coverage" LDFLAGS="--coverage" make test

If you are using `g++` use `gcov` to generate a report (results are in `*.gcov`
files):

    gcov -lp test/*tests.o test/t/*/*test_cases.o

If you are using `clang++` use `llvm-cov` instead:

    llvm-cov gcov -lp test/*tests.o test/t/*/*test_cases.o

If you are using `g++` you can use `gcovr` to generate nice HTML output:

    mkdir -p coverage
    gcovr -r . --html --html-details -o coverage/index.html

Open `coverage/index.html` in your browser to see the report.


## Cppcheck

For extra checks with [Cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) you can call

    make check
