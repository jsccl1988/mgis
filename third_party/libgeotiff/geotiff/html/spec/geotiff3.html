<p>
Here are some examples of how GeoTIFF may be implemented at the  Tag and GeoKey
level, following the general "Cookbook" approach above. <p>

 <h4><a name="3.1.1.">3.1.1. UTM Projected Aerial Photo</a></h4>
<pre>   </pre><tt>We
have an aerial photo which has been orthorectified and resampled to a UTM grid,
zone 60, using WGS84 datum; the coordinates of the upper-left corner of the
image is are given in easting/northing, as 350807.4m, 5316081.3m. The scanned
map pixel scale is 100 meters/pixels (the actual dpi scanning ratio is
irrelevant).</tt>
<pre>
      ModelTiepointTag       = (0, 0, 0,  350807.4, 5316081.3, 0.0)
      ModelPixelScaleTag      = (100.0, 100.0, 0.0)
      GeoKeyDirectoryTag:
            GTModelTypeGeoKey        =  1      (ModelTypeProjected)
            GTRasterTypeGeoKey       =  1      (RasterPixelIsArea)
            ProjectedCSTypeGeoKey    =  32660  (PCS_WGS84_UTM_zone_60N)
            PCSCitationGeoKey        =  "UTM Zone 60 N with WGS84"


   Notes:
   1) We did not need to specify the GCS lat-long, since the
      PCS_WGS84_UTM_zone_60N codes implies particular
      GCS and units already (WGS_84 and meters). The citation
      was added just for documentation.

   2)  The "GeoKeyDirectoryTag" is expressed using the "GeoKey"
   structure defined above. At the TIFF level the tags look like
   this:
      GeoKeyDirectoryTag=(  1,     0,     2,       4,
                         1024,     0,     1,       1,
                         1025,     0,     1,       1,
                         3072,     0,     1,       32660,
                         3073, 34737,    25,       0 )
      GeoAsciiParamsTag(34737)=("UTM Zone 60 N with WGS84|")

   For the rest of these examples we will only show the GeoKey-level
   dump, with the understanding that the actual TIFF-level tag
   representation can be determined from the documentation.

 <h4><a name="3.1.2.">3.1.2. Standard State Plane</a></h4>
<pre>      </pre><tt>We
have a USGS State Plane Map of Texas, Central Zone, using NAD83, correctly
oriented. The map resolution is 1000 meters/pixel, at origin. There is a grid
intersection line in the image at pixel location (50,100), and corresponds to
the projected coordinate system easting/northing of (949465.0, 3070309.1).</tt>
<pre>
      ModelTiepointTag           = (  50,  100, 0, 949465.0, 3070309.1, 0)
      ModelPixelScaleTag         = (1000, 1000, 0)
      GeoKeyDirectoryTag:
            GTModelTypeGeoKey            =  1   (ModelTypeProjected)
            GTRasterTypeGeoKey           =  1   (RasterPixelIsArea)
            ProjectedCSTypeGeoKey        = 32139 (PCS_NAD83_Texas_Central)
    Notice that in this case, since the PCS is a standard code, we
    do not need to define the GCS, datum, etc, since those are implied
    by the PCS code. Also, since this is NAD83, meters are used rather
    than US Survey feet (as in NAD 27).

 <h4><a name="3.1.3.">3.1.3. Lambert Conformal Conic Aeronautical Chart</a></h4>
<pre>      </pre><tt>We
have a 500 x 500 scanned aeronautical chart of Seattle, WA, using Lambert
Conformal Conic projection, correctly oriented. The central meridian is at 120
degrees west. The map resolution is 1000 meters/pixel, at origin, and uses
NAD27 datum. The standard parallels of the projection are at 41d20m N and
48d40m N. The latitude of the origin is at 45 degrees North, and occurs in the
image at the raster coordinates (80,100). The origin is given a false easting
and northing of 200000m, 1500000m.</tt>

                 ProjStdParallel2GeoKey     =  48.666
                 ProjCenterLongGeoKey       =-120.0

                 ProjFalseNorthingGeoKey,   = 1500000.0
   Notice that the Tiepoint takes the false easting and northing into
   account when tying the raster point (50,100) to the projection origin.

 <h4><a name="3.1.4.">3.1.4. DMA ADRG Raster Graphic Map</a></h4>

U.S. Defense Mapping Agency produces ARC digitized raster graphics datasets by

have an aerial photo, and know only the WGS84 GPS location of several points in
the scene: the upper left corner is 120 degrees West, 32 degrees North, the
lower-left corner is at 120 degrees West, 30 degrees 20 minutes North, and the
lower-right hand corner of the image is at 116 degrees 40 minutes  West, 30
degrees 20 minutes North. The  photo is not geometrically corrected, however,
and the complete projection is therefore not known.</tt>

    Remark: Since we have not specified the ModelPixelScaleTag, clients
       reading this GeoTIFF file are not permitted to infer that there
       is a simple linear relationship between the raster data and the
       geographic model coordinate space. The only points that are know
       to be exact are the ones specified in the tiepoint tag.

 <h4><a name="3.2.2.">3.2.2. Rotated Scanned Map</a></h4>
<pre>   </pre><tt>We
have a scanned standard British National Grid, covering the 100km grid zone NZ.
Consulting documentation for BNG we find that the southwest corner of the NZ
zone has an easting,northing of 400000m, 500000m, relative to the BNG standard
false origin. This scanned map has a resolution of 100 meter pixels, and was
rotated 90 degrees to fit onto the scanner, so that the southwest corner is now
the northwest corner. In this case we must use the ModelTransformation tag
rather than the tiepoint/scale pair to map the raster data into model
space:</tt>

 <h4><a name="3.2.3.">3.2.3. Digital Elevation Model</a></h4>
<tt>The DMA stores digital elevation models using an equirectangular
projection, so that it may be indexed with WGS84 geographic coordinates. Since
elevation postings are point-values, the pixels should not be considered as
filling areas, but as point-values at grid vertices. To accommodate the base
elevation of the Angeles Crest forest, the pixel value of 0 corresponds to an
elevation of 1000 meters relative to WGS84 reference ellipsoid. The upper left
corner is at 120 degrees West, 32 degrees North, and has a pixel scale of 0.2
degrees/pixel longitude, 0.1 degrees/pixel latitude.<p>

<pre>      ModelTiepointTag=(0.0, 0.0, 0.0,  -120.0,       32.0,    1000.0)
      ModelPixelScale = (0.2, 0.1, 1.0)

<pre>   Remarks:
          1) Note the "RasterPixelIsPoint" raster space, indicating that
             the DEM posting of the first pixel is at the raster point
             (0,0,0), and therefore corresponds to 120W,32N exactly.
          2) The third value of the "PixelScale" is 1.0 to indicate
             that a single pixel-value unit corresponds to 1 meter,
             and the last tiepoint value indicates that base value
             zero indicates 1000m above the reference surface.</pre><tt><p>
