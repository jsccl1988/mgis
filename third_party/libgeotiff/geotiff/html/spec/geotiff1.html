 <h3><a name="1.1">1.1 About this Specification</a></h3>
<tt><p>
This is a description of a proposal to specify the content and structure of a
group of industry-standard tag sets for the management of georeference or
geocoded raster imagery using Aldus-Adobe's public domain Tagged-Image File
Format (TIFF). <p>
  <p>
This specification closely follows the organization and structure of the TIFF
specification document.<p>

 <h4><a name="1.1.1">1.1.1 Background</a></h4>
<tt><p>
TIFF has emerged as one of the world's most popular raster file formats. But
TIFF remains limited in cartographic applications, since no publicly available,
stable structure for conveying geographic information presently exists in the
public domain.<p>
<p>
Several private solutions exist for recording cartographic information in TIFF
tags. Intergraph has a mature and sophisticated geotie tag implementation, but
this remains within the private TIFF tagset registered exclusively to
Intergraph. Other companies (such as ESRI, and Island Graphics) have geographic
solutions which are also proprietary or limited by specific application to
their software's architecture. <p>
<p>
Many GIS companies, raster data providers, and their clients have requested
that the companies concerned with delivery and exploitation of raster
geographic imagery develop a publicly available, platform interoperable
standard for the support of geographic TIFF imagery. Such TIFF imagery would
originate from satellite imaging platforms, aerial platforms, scans of aerial
photography or paper maps, or as a result of geographic analysis. TIFF images
which were supported by the public "geotie" tagset would be able to be read and
positioned correctly in any GIS or digital mapping system which supports the
"GeoTIFF" standard, as proposed in this document. <p>
<p>
The savings to the users and providers of raster data and exploitation
softwares are potentially significant. With a platform interoperable GeoTIFF
file, companies could stop spending excessive development resource in support
of any and all proprietary formats which are invented. Data providers may be
able to produce off-the-shelf imagery products which can be delivered in the
"generic" TIFF format quickly and possibly at lower cost. End-users will have
the advantage of developed software that exploits the GeoTIFF tags
transparently. Most importantly, the same raster TIFF image which can be read
and modified in one GIS environment may be equally exploitable in another GIS
environment without requiring any file duplication or import/export operation.

 <h4><a name="1.1.2">1.1.2 History</a></h4>
<tt><p>
The initial efforts to define a TIFF "geotie" specification began under the
leadership of Ed Grissom at Intergraph, and others in the early 1990's. In 1994
a formal GeoTIFF mailing-list was created and maintained by Niles Ritter at
JPL, which quickly grew to over 140 subscribers from government and industry.
The purpose of the list is to discuss common goals and interests in developing
an industry-wide GeoTIFF standard, and culminated in a conference in March of
1995 hosted by SPOT Image, with representatives from USGS, Intergraph, ESRI,
ERDAS, SoftDesk, MapInfo, NASA/JPL, and others, in which the current working
proposal for GeoTIFF was outlined. The outline was condensed into a prerelease
GeoTIFF specification document by Niles Ritter, and Mike Ruth of SPOT Image.<p>
Following discussions with Dr. Roger Lott of the European Petroleum Survey
Group (EPSG), the GeoTIFF projection parametrization method was extensively
modified, and brought into compatibility with both the POSC Epicentre model,
and the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) metadata approaches.<p>
 </tt>
<img src="gifs/clrbar_half.gif">
 <h4><a name="1.1.3">1.1.3 Scope</a></h4>
<tt><p>
The GeoTIFF spec defines a set of TIFF tags provided to describe all
"Cartographic" information associated with TIFF imagery that originates from
satellite imaging systems, scanned aerial photography, scanned maps, digital
elevation models, or as a result of geographic analyses. Its aim is to allow
means for tying a raster image to a known model space or map projection, and
for describing those projections.<p>
<p>
GeoTIFF does not intend to become a replacement for existing geographic data
interchange standards, such as the USGS SDTS standard or the FGDC metadata
standard. Rather, it aims to augment an existing popular raster-data format to
support georeferencing and geocoding information.<p>
<p>
The tags documented in this spec are to be considered completely orthogonal to
the raster-data descriptions of the TIFF spec, and impose no restrictions on
how the standard TIFF tags are to be interpreted, which color spaces or
compression types are to be used, etc.<p>
 <p>
 </tt>
<img src="gifs/clrbar_half.gif">
 <h4><a name="1.1.4">1.1.4 Features</a></h4>
<pre></pre><tt>GeoTIFF
fully complies with the TIFF 6.0 specifications, and its extensions do not in
any way go against the TIFF recommendations, nor do they limit the scope of
raster data supported by TIFF.<p>
<p>
GeoTIFF uses a small set of reserved TIFF tags to store a broad range of
georeferencing information, catering to geographic as well as projected
coordinate systems needs. Projections include UTM, US State Plane and National
Grids, as well as the underlying projection types such as Transverse Mercator,
Lambert Conformal Conic, etc. No information is stored in private structures,
IFD's or other mechanisms which would hide information from naive TIFF reading
software.<p>
<p>
GeoTIFF uses a "MetaTag" (GeoKey) approach to encode dozens of information
elements into just 6 tags, taking advantage of TIFF platform-independent data
format representation to avoid cross-platform interchange difficulties. These
keys are designed in a manner parallel to standard TIFF tags, and closely
follow the TIFF discipline in their structure and layout. New keys may be
defined as needs arise, within the current framework, and without requiring the
allocation of new tags from Aldus/Adobe.<p>
<p>
GeoTIFF uses numerical codes to describe projection types, coordinate systems,
datums, ellipsoids, etc. The projection, datums and ellipsoid codes are derived
from the EPSG list compiled by the Petrotechnical Open Software Corporation
(POSC), and mechanisms for adding further international projections, datums and
ellipsoids has been established. The GeoTIFF information content is designed to
be compatible with the data decomposition approach used by the National Spatial
Data Infrastructure (NSDI) of the U.S. Federal Geographic Data Committee
(FGDC).<p>
<p>
While GeoTIFF provides a robust framework for specifying a broad class of
existing Projected coordinate systems, it is also fully extensible, permitting
internal, private or proprietary information storage. However, since this
standard arose from the need to avoid multiple proprietary encoding systems,
use of private implementations is to be discouraged.<p>

 <h4><a name="1.2.1">1.2.1 Revision Nomenclature</a></h4>
<tt>A Revision of GeoTIFF specifications will be denoted by two integers
separated by a decimal, indicating the Major and Minor revision numbers.
GeoTIFF stores most of its information using a "Key-Code" pairing system; the
Major revision number will only be incremented when a substantial addition or
modification is made to the list of information Keys, while the Minor Revision
number permits incremental augmentation of the list of valid codes.<p>

 <h4><a name="1.2.3">1.2.3 Clarifications</a></h4>
<pre>
Revision 1.0.1:
 o GeoTIFF web page and ftp site updated to remotesensing.org.

Revision 1.0:
 o The former ModelTransformationTag (33920) conflicts with
   an internal Intergraph implementation and is being deprecated,
   in favor of a new tag (34264, registered to JPL).
 o The "Origin" keys have been renamed with "Natural" or "Nat"
   prefixes, to distinguish from "False" origins, and to have
   a closer match to EPSG/POSC terminology. All Revision 0.2
   names shall be recognized in a backward-compatible fashion.
 o The GeoTIFF web page addresses have been moved and may now be found at:
     http://www.earthlink.net/~ritter/geotiff/geotiff.html

Revision 0.2:
 o South Oriented Gauss Conformal is Transverse Mercator with South
   pointing up, and so has been given a distinct code, rather than
   aliased to Transverse Mercator.

Revision 0.1:
 o GeoTIFF-writers shall store the GeoKey entries in key-sorted order
   within the GeoKeyDirectoryTag. This is a change from preliminary
   discussions which permitted arbitrary order, and more closely follows
   the TIFF discipline.
 o The third value "ScaleZ" in ModelPixelScaleTag = (ScaleX, ScaleY,
   ScaleZ) shall by default be set to 0, not 1, as suggested in preliminary
   discussions. This is because most standard model spaces are
   2-dimensional (flat), and therefore its vertical shape is
   independent of the pixel-value.

 o The code 32767 shall be used to imply "user-defined", rather than
   16384. This avoids breaking up the reserved public GeoKey code space
   into two discontiguous ranges, 0-16383 and 16385-32767.

 o If a GeoKey is coded "undefined", then it is exactly that; no
   parameters should be provided (e.g. EllipsoidSemiMajorAxis, etc).
   To provide parameters for a non-coded attribute, use "user-defined".

 <h4><a name="1.2.6">1.2.6 Agenda for Future Development</a></h4>
<tt><p>
Revision 1.0, which is the first true "Baseline" revision, is proposed to
support well-documented, public, relatively simple Projected Coordinate Systems
(PCS), including most commonly used and supported in the international public
domains today, together with their underlying map-projection systems. Following
the critiques of the 0.x Revision phase, the 1.0 Revision spec is hereby
released in Sept '95. <p>
<p>
In the coming year, incremental 1.x augmentations to the "codes" list will be
established, as well as discussions regarding the future "2.0" requirements.<p>
<p>
The Revision 2.0 phase is proposed to extend the capability of the GeoTIFF
tagsets beyond PCS projections into more complex map projection geometries,
including single-project, single-vendor, or proprietary cartographic solutions.

<tt>As with TIFF, in GeoTIFF private "GeoKeys" and codes may be used, starting
with 32768 and above. Unlike the TIFF spec, however, these private key-spaces
will not be reserved, and are only to be used for private, internal purposes.

The current maintainer of the GeoTIFF specification is Niles Ritter, though
this may change at a later time. Projection codes are maintained through
EPSG/POSC, and a mechanism for change/additions will be established through the
