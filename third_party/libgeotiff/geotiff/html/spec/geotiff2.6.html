<tt>The purpose of Geotiff is to allow the definitive identification of
georeferenced locations within a raster dataset. This is generally accomplished
through tying raster space coordinates to a model space coordinate system, when
no further information is required. In the GeoTIFF nomenclature,
"georeferencing" refers to tying raster space to a model space M, while
"geocoding" refers to defining how the model space M assigns coordinates to
points on the earth.<p>
The three tags defined below may be used for defining the relationship between
R and M, and the relationship may be diagrammed as:<p>
</tt>
<pre>           ModelPixelScaleTag
           ModelTiepointTag
    R  ------------ OR --------------&gt; M
  (I,J,K)  ModelTransformationTag   (X,Y,Z)
                  </pre><tt><p>
The next section describes these Baseline georeferencing tags in detail.<p>

 <h4><a name="2.6.1">2.6.1 GeoTIFF Tags for Coordinate Transformations</a></h4>
<tt>For most common applications, the transformation between raster and model
space may be defined with a set of raster-to-model tiepoints and scaling
parameters. The following two tags may be used for this purpose:<p>
</tt>
<pre>ModelTiepointTag:
      Tag = 33922 (8482.H)
      Type = DOUBLE (IEEE Double precision)
      N = 6*K,  K = number of tiepoints
      Alias: GeoreferenceTag
      Owner: Intergraph</pre><tt><p>
This tag stores raster-&gt;model tiepoint pairs in the order <p>
</tt>
<pre>        ModelTiepointTag = (...,I,J,K, X,Y,Z...),</pre><tt><p>
where (I,J,K) is the point at location (I,J) in raster space with pixel-value
K, and (X,Y,Z) is a vector in model space. In most cases the model space is
only two-dimensional, in which case both K and Z should be set to zero; this
third dimension is provided in anticipation of future support for 3D digital
elevation models and vertical coordinate systems. <p>
<p>
A raster image may be georeferenced simply by specifying its location, size and
orientation in the model coordinate space M. This may be done by specifying the
location of three of the four bounding corner points. However, tiepoints are
only to be considered exact at the points specified; thus defining such a set
of bounding tiepoints does <b>not</b> imply that the model space locations of
the interior of the image may be exactly computed by a linear interpolation of
these tiepoints.<p>
<p>
However, since the relationship between the Raster space and the model space
will often be an exact, affine transformation, this relationship can be defined
using one set of tiepoints and the "ModelPixelScaleTag", described below, which
gives the vertical and horizontal raster grid cell size, specified in model
units. <p>
<p>
If possible, the first tiepoint placed in this tag shall be the one
establishing the location of the point (0,0) in raster space. However, if this
is not possible (for example, if (0,0) is goes to a part of model space in
which the projection is ill-defined), then there is no particular order in
which the tiepoints need be listed.<p>
<p>
For orthorectification or mosaicking applications a large number of tiepoints
may be specified on a mesh over the raster image. However, the definition of
associated grid interpolation methods is not in the scope of the current
GeoTIFF spec.<p>
<p>
Remark: As mentioned in  <a href="geotiff2.5.html#2.5.1">section 2.5.1</a>, all GeoTIFF information is independent
of the XPosition, YPosition, and Orientation tags of the standard TIFF 6.0
spec.<p>
<p>
The next two tags are optional tags provided for defining exact affine
transformations between raster and model space; baseline GeoTIFF files may use
either, but shall never use both within the same TIFF image directory.</tt>
<pre>
ModelPixelScaleTag:
      Tag = 33550
      Type = DOUBLE (IEEE Double precision)
      N = 3
      Owner: SoftDesk</pre><tt><p>
This tag may be used to specify the size of raster pixel spacing in the model
space units, when the raster space can be embedded in the model space
coordinate system without rotation, and consists of the following 3 values:<p>
</tt>
<pre>    ModelPixelScaleTag = (ScaleX, ScaleY, ScaleZ)</pre><tt>
   <p>
where ScaleX and ScaleY give the horizontal and vertical spacing of raster
pixels. The ScaleZ is primarily used to map the pixel value of a digital
elevation model into the correct Z-scale, and so for most other purposes this
value should be zero (since most model spaces are 2-D, with Z=0).<p>
<p>
A single tiepoint in the ModelTiepointTag, together with this tag, completely
determine the relationship between raster and model space; thus they comprise
the two tags which Baseline GeoTIFF files most often will use to place a raster
image into a "standard position" in model space.<p>
<p>
Like the Tiepoint tag, this tag information is independent of the XPosition,
YPosition, Resolution and Orientation tags of the standard TIFF 6.0 spec.
However, simple reversals of orientation between raster and model space (e.g.
horizontal or vertical flips) may be indicated by reversal of sign in the
corresponding component of the ModelPixelScaleTag. GeoTIFF compliant readers
must honor this sign-reversal convention.<p>
<p>
This tag must not be used if the raster image requires rotation or shearing to
place it into the standard model space. In such cases the transformation shall
be defined with the more general ModelTransformationTag, defined below. <p>
</tt>
<pre>ModelTransformationTag
      Tag  =  34264  (85D8.H)
      Type =  DOUBLE
      N    =  16
      Owner: JPL Cartographic Applications Group</pre><tt><p>
This tag may be used to specify the transformation matrix between the raster
space (and its dependent pixel-value space) and the (possibly 3D) model space.
If specified, the tag shall have the following organization:<p>
</tt>
<pre>      ModelTransformationTag = (a,b,c,d,e....m,n,o,p).</pre><tt><p>
where</tt>
<pre>
        model                              image
        coords =          matrix     *     coords</pre><tt>

        |-   -|     |-                 -|  |-   -|</pre><tt><p>
<p>
By convention, and without loss of generality, the following parameters are
currently hard-coded and will always be the same (but must be specified
nonetheless):<p>
</tt>
<pre>       m = n = o = 0,  p = 1.</pre><tt><p>
For Baseline GeoTIFF, the model space is always 2-D, and so the matrix will
have the more limited form:<p>
</tt>
<pre>        |-   -|     |-                 -|  |-   -|
        |  X  |     |   a   b   0   d   |  |  I  |
        |     |     |                   |  |     |
        |  Y  |     |   e   f   0   h   |  |  J  |
        |     |  =  |                   |  |     |
        |  Z  |     |   0   0   0   0   |  |  K  |

        |  1  |     |   0   0   0   1   |  |  1  |
        |-   -|     |-                 -|  |-   -|</pre><tt><p>
 <p>
Values "d" and "h" will often be used to represent translations in  X and Y,
and so will not necessarily be zero. All 16 values should be specified, in all
cases. Only the raster-to-model transformation is defined; if the inverse
transformation is required it must be computed by the client, to the desired
accuracy.<p>
<p>
This matrix tag should not be used if the ModelTiepointTag and the
ModelPixelScaleTag are already defined. If only a single tiepoint (I,J,K,X,Y,Z)
is specified, and the ModelPixelScale = (Sx, Sy, Sz) is specified, then the
corresponding transformation matrix may be computed from them as:<p>
</tt>
<pre>        |-                         -|
        |   Sx    0.0   0.0   Tx    |
        |                           |      Tx = X - I*Sx
        |   0.0  -Sy    0.0   Ty    |      Ty = Y + J*Sy
        |                           |      Tz = Z - K*Sz
        |   0.0   0.0   Sz    Tz    |
        |                           |
        |   0.0   0.0   0.0   1.0   |
        |-                         -| </pre><tt><p>
where the -Sy is due the reversal of direction from J increasing- down in
raster space to Y increasing-up in model space.<p>
Like the Tiepoint tag, this tag information is independent of the XPosition,
YPosition, and Orientation tags of the standard TIFF 6.0 spec.<p>
<p>
Note: In Revision 0.2 and earlier, another tag was used for this matrix, which
has been renamed as follows:</tt>
<pre>IntergraphMatrixTag
      Tag  =  33920  (8480.H)
      Type =  DOUBLE
      N    =  17 (Intergraph implementation) or 16 (GeoTIFF 0.2 impl.)
      Owner: Intergraph</pre><tt><p>
This tag conflicts with an internal software implementation at Intergraph, and
so its use is no longer encouraged. A GeoTIFF reader should look first for the
new tag, and only if it is not found should it check for this older tag. If
found, it should only consider it to be contain valid GeoTIFF matrix
information if the tag-count is 16; the Intergraph version uses 17 values.<p>

 <h4><a name="2.6.3">2.6.3 Cookbook for Defining Transformations</a></h4>
<pre>
Here is a 4-step guide to producing a set of Baseline GeoTIFF tags for defining coordinate transformation information of a raster dataset.

  Step 1: Establish the Raster Space coordinate system used:
          RasterPixelIsArea or RasterPixelIsPoint.

  Step 2: Establish/define the model space Type in which the image is
          to be georeferenced. Usually this will be a Projected
          Coordinate system (PCS). If you are geocoding this data
          set, then the model space is defined to be the corresponding
          geographic, geocentric or Projected coordinate system (skip
          to the "Cookbook"  <a href="geotiff2.7.html#2.7.3">section 2.7.3</a> first to do determine this).

  Step 3: Identify the nature of the transformations needed to tie
          the raster data down to the model space coordinate system:

     Case 1: The model-location of a raster point (x,y) is known, but not
          the scale or orientations:

            Use the ModelTiepointTag to define the (X,Y,Z) coordinates
            of the known raster point.


     Case 2: The location of three non-collinear raster points are known
          exactly, but the linearity of the transformation is not known.

          Use the ModelTiepointTag to define the (X,Y,Z) coordinates
          of all three known raster points. Do not compute or define the
          ModelPixelScale or ModelTransformation tag.

     Case 3: The position and scale of the data is known exactly, and
          no rotation or shearing is needed to fit into the model space.

          Use the ModelTiepointTag to define the (X,Y,Z) coordinates
          of the known raster point, and the ModelPixelScaleTag to
          specify the scale.

     Case 4: The raster data requires rotation and/or lateral shearing to
          fit into the defined model space:

          Use the ModelTransformation matrix to define the transformation.

     Case 5: The raster data cannot be fit into the model space with a
          simple affine transformation (rubber-sheeting required).

          Use only the ModelTiepoint tag, and specify as many
          tiepoints as your application requires. Note, however, that
          this is not a Baseline GeoTIFF implementation, and should
          not be used for interchange; it is recommended that the image be
          geometrically rectified first, and put into a standard projected
          coordinate system.
   Step 4: Install the defined tag values in the TIFF file and close it.</pre><tt><p>
