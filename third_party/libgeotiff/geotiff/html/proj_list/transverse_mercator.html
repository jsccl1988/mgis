<h3>EPSG Notes</h3>

The Transverse Mercator projection in its various forms is the most widely used projected
coordinate system for world topographical and offshore mapping. All versions have the
same basic characteristics and formulas. The differences which distinguish the different
forms of the projection which are applied in different countries arise from variations in the
choice of the coordinate transformation parameters, namely the latitude of the origin, the
longitude of the origin (central meridian), the scale factor at the origin (on the central
meridian), and the values of False Easting and False Northing, which embody the units of
measurement, given to the origin. Additionally there are variations in the width of the
longitudinal zones for the projections used in different territories.

The following table indicates the variations in the projection parameters which distinguish
the different forms of the Transverse Mercator projection and are used in the Epicentre
Transverse Mercator projection method:

The most familiar and commonly used Transverse Mercator is the Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM) whose natural origin lies on the equator. However, some territories use
a Transverse Mercator with a natural origin at a latitude closer to that territory.

In Epicentre the coordinate transformation method is the same for all forms of the
Transverse Mercator projection. The formulas to derive the projected Easting and
Northing coordinates are in the form of a series as follows:
<p>

<pre>

	Easting, E =  FE + k0*[A + (1 - T + C)A3/6 + (5 - 18T + T2 + 72C - 58e'2)A5/120]

	Northing, N =  FN + k0{M - M0 + *tan*[A2/2 + (5 - T + 9C + 4C2)A4/24 +
				(61 - 58T + T2 + 600C - 330e'2)A6/720]}
where	T = tan2*
	C = e2 cos2*/(1 - e2) = e'2 cos2*
	A = (* - *0)cos*, with * and *0 in radians
	M = a[(1 - e2/4 - 3e4/64 - 5e6/256 -....)* - (3e2/8 + 3e4/32 + 45e6/1024+....)sin2*
		+ (15e4/256 + 45e6/1024 +.....)sin4* - (35e6/3072 + ....)sin6* + .....]
	with * in radians and M0 for *0, the latitude of the origin, derived in the same way.
</pre>

The reverse formulas to convert Easting and Northing projected coordinates to latitude
and longitude are:
<p>

<pre>

	* = *1 - (*1tan*1/*1)[D2/2 - (5 + 3T1 + 10C1 - 4C12 - 9e'2)D4/24
			+ (61 + 90T1 + 298C1 + 45T12 - 252e'2 - 3C12)D6/720]
	* = *0 + [D - (1 + 2T1 + C1)D3/6 + (5 - 2C1 + 28T1 - 3C12 + 8e'2
			+ 24T12)D5/120] / cos*1
where *1 may be found as for the Cassini projection from:

	*1 = *1 + (3e1/2 - 27e13/32 +.....)sin2*1 + (21e12/16 -55e14/32 + ....)sin4*1
		+ (151e13/96 +.....)sin6*1 + (1097e14/512 - ....)sin8*1 + ......
and where
	e1 = [1- (1 - e2)1/2]/[1 + (1 - e2)1/2]
	*1 = M1/[a(1 - e2/4 - 3e4/64 - 5e6/256 - ....)]
	M1 = M0 + (N - FN)/k0
	T1 = tan2*1
	C1 = e'2cos2*1
	D = (E - FE)/(*1k0), with *1 = * for *1
</pre>

For areas south of the equator the value of latitude * will be negative and the formulas
above, to compute the E and N,  will automatically result in the correct values. Note that
the false northings of the origin, if the equator, will need to be large to avoid negative
northings and for the UTM projection is in fact 10,000,000m. Alternatively, as in the case
of Argentina's Transverse Mercator (Gauss-Kruger) zones, the origin is at the south pole
with a northings of zero. However each zone central meridian takes a false easting of
500000m prefixed by an identifying zone number. This ensures that instead of points in
different zones having the same eastings, every point in the country, irrespective of its
projection zone, will have a unique set of projected system coordinates. Strict application
of the above formulas, with south latitudes negative, will result in the derivation of the
correct Eastings and Northings.

Similarly, in applying the reverse formulas to determine a latitude south of the equator, a
negative sign for * results from a negative *1 which in turn results from a negative M1.","For Projected Coordinate System OSGB 1936 / British National Grid
