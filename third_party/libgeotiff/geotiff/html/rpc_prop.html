<h1>RPCs in GeoTIFF</h1>

This technical note is a proposed extension to the GeoTIFF 1.0
specification to incorporate support for a ratio of polynomials to
relate (lat,long,height) locations with (row,column) locations in the
image.  This geometric model is often referred to as RPCs.<p>

This extension proposes to stored essentially the same information as
is stored in the RPC00B segment of an NITF file, but within a GeoTIFF
tag.  The RPC00B element of NITF is defined in the
<a href="STDI-0002_v2.1.pdf">STDI-0002 2.1 (16Nov2000)</a>
specification document.  The mathematical model is defined in 8.2.4 of
that document, and the disk layout of the information is defined in
8.3.12 of that document.<p>

This proposal is being developed in cooperation with the ASPRS
Softcopy Photogrammetry Committee, and is not yet adopted as part of
the GeoTIFF specification.  It is intended to be in line with the
(still under development) section within ISO 19130 specification
discussion of RPCs.<p>

<h2>Mathematical Model</h2>

The following is adapted closely from STDI-0002 2.1 (8.2.4).<p>

The geometric sensor model describing the physical relationship between
image coordinates and ground coordinate is known as a Rigorous Projection
Model. A Rigorous Projection Model expresses the mapping of the image space
coordinates of rows and columns (r,c) onto the object space reference surface
geodetic coordinates ( &phi;, &lambda;, h ).<p>

RPC supports a generic description of the Rigorous Projection Models. The
approximation used by RPC00 is a set of rational polynomials exp ressing the
normalized row and column values, (r<sub>n</sub> , c<sub>n</sub>), as a
function of normalized geodetic latitude, longitude, and height, (P, L, H),
given a set of normalized polynomial coefficients (LINE_NUM_COEF_n,
LINE_DEN_COEF_n, SAMP_NUM_COEF_n, SAMP_DEN_COEF_n). Normalized values, rather
than actual values are used in order to minimize introduction of errors during
the calculations. The transformation between row and column values (r,c), and
normalized row and column values (r<sub>n</sub>, c<sub>n</sub>), and between
the geodetic latitude, longitude, and height ( &phi;, &lambda;, h ), and
normalized geodetic latitude, longitude, and height (P, L, H), is defined by a
set of normalizing translations (offsets) and scales that ensure all values
are contained i the range -1 to +1.<p>

<pre>
        P = (Latitude     - LAT_OFF)    / LAT_SCALE
        L = (Longitude    - LONG_OFF)   / LONG_SCALE
        H = (Height       - HEIGHT_OFF) / HEIGHT_SCALE
        r<sub>n</sub> = (Row         - LINE_OFF)   / LINE_SCALE
        c<sub>n</sub> = (Column      - SAMP_OFF)   / SAMP_SCALE
</pre>

The rational function polynomial equations are defined as:<p>

<img src="rpc_eq1.gif"><p>

The rational function polynomial equation numerators and denominators each
are 20-term cubic polynomial functions of the form:<p>

<img src="rpc_eq2.gif"><p>

where coefficients C<SUB>1</SUB> ... C<SUB>20</SUB> represent the following
sets of coefficients:
LINE_NUM_COEF_n, LINE_DEN_COEF_n, SAMP_NUM_COEF_n, SAMP_DEN_COEF_n<p>

The image coordinates are in units of pixels. The ground coordinates are
latitude and longitude in units of decimal degrees and the height above
ellipsoid in units of meters. The ground coordinates are referenced to
WGS84.<p>

Note: The order of terms differs between different applications. This order is
used with RPC00B and the Digital Point Positioning Data Base.
RPC00A uses a different term order.<p>

<h2>Encoding in GeoTIFF</h2>

The full set of NITF RPC00B values (excepting the CETAG, CEL and SUCCESS
values) are encoded in a new TIFF tag, RPCCoefficientTag as 92 double
precision values.<p>

<pre>
RPCCoefficientTag:
       Tag = 50844
       Type = DOUBLE (IEEE Double precision)
       N = 92
       Owner: Frank Warmerdam
</pre>

The elements of this tag are:<p>

<h2>Commentary</h2>

The RPC model allows a row/column location to be computed for a given
lat, long and height value.  It is not inherently invertable, though it
is usually possible to compute at lat,long location from a row, column
and height value using iterative methods. <p>

The RPC model in a GeoTIFF file is suplimentary to all other GeoTIFF tags
and not directly related.  That is, it is possible to have a conventional
set of GeoTIFF tags (such as a tiepoint + pixel scale + projected coordinate
system description) along with the RPCCoefficientTag.  The RPCCoefficientTag
is always describing a transformation to WGS84, regardless of what
geographic coordinate system might be described in the coordinate system
description tags of the GeoTIFF file.  It is also possible to have only
the RPCCoefficientTag tag and no other GeoTIFF tags.<p>

The NITF RPC00B format uses limited prevision ascii encoded numbers for
coefficients.  Serializing internal "double precision IEEE" values to this
format can result in a number of precision problems.  The GeoTIFF
representation stores all values as 64 bit IEEE double precision floating
point values in the file, and should be more compatible with internal
software representations of the model.<p>

<h2>Error Bias And Error Random</h2>

The STDI-0002 describes ERR_BIAS as "Error - Bias. 68% non time-varying error
estimate assumes correlated images." and ERR_RAND as "Error - Random. 68%
time-varying error estimate assumes uncorrelated images."  It is the intent
that the ERR_BIAS and ERR_RAND fields in GeoTIFF should be the same as
the values in the NITF; however, a more detailed explanation of the
meaning, and rules for populating these fields would be very desirable.<p>

If no ERR_BIAS or ERR_RAND values are available, the special value of -999.0
will be used.  Any negative value should be interpreted as "no error estimates
available". <p>

<h2>Outstanding Issues</h2>

<ol>

<li> It would be very desirable to provide sample file(s) demonstrating
this format.  I have a variety of NITF datasets with RPCs, but none
appear to be publishable information.  If anyone can provide an NITF
dataset appropriate for redistribution, with an RPC00B Tagged Record Extension (TRE), I would be
happy to translate it into GeoTIFF format as a demonstrator.<p>


<li> It has been suggested that we carry the CETAG value from NITF
along as well, and allow selection of either RPC00A or RPC00B coefficient
ordering (by Albert Zobrista / JPL) but I don't see much point in supporting
both options.  Instead I have tried to specifically select the ordering
of RPC00B and stick with just that.  It is trivial for a translator to
reorder coefficients if needed internally but having two orders in the file
seems unnecessary.<p>
